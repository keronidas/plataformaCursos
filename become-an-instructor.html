                <h2>Steps to Become an Instructor</h2>
                <p>Instructors create lesson plans and implement them in a classroom or on online platforms. While
                    formal education is necessary, instructors must also possess skills that you can't always learn in
                    an academic setting. Successful instructors excel at communication, leadership, and problem-solving.
                    Remember that, as an instructor, you're responsible for educating a diverse group of people, so it's
                    essential to have empathy and cultural awareness. Having a mentor in the field can give you insight
                    into balancing the curriculum with your students' needs.</p>
                <p>Take these steps if you want to become an instructor:</p>

                            <h3>Earn a relevant degree to what you want to instruct</h3>
                            <p>Colleges and universities expect instructors to have at least a bachelor's degree in the
                                subject they want to teach. For example, if you want to teach literature, you should
                                have a Bachelor of Arts in English. Many schools prefer candidates with master's
                                degrees, and even if they don't, it's well worth it to pursue one. A master's degree can
                                help you stand out among potential hires and make you eligible for salary increases and
                                promotions. If you plan on earning tenure or want to participate in academic research,
                                you'll need to earn your doctorate after completing your bachelor's and master's
                                degrees.</p>

                                and look good on your resume. Undergrad TAs typically assist professors with grading
                                papers and proctoring exams. If you work as a TA in grad school, you can expect to teach
                                classes, work with students in lab settings, and assist the professor with research.
